Sup! I'm Alexa, This is my first Rails conference. How you enjoying it? It's so hot here in Phoenix, you'd think I'd be used to that being from the Amazon. I love DHH, he writes the best codes and rants so well about shitty startups. I also really like Tender love, but I can beat his puns any day. Come at me bro! Just joking Tender love. Here is some advice. Don't give up on your dreams. Keep sleeping.
